Santa Fe Venture Studio

Santa Fe Venture Studio co-founds startups with tenacious, traction-obsessed partners. We hunt in crypto, fintech, commerce and content.

We like capital-light, employee-light businesses where we can simplify a complex problem through unfair advantages we have through team,  network, and a key insight.

- We like to find ways to test the hypothesis in the fastest way with the least effort.
- We don't invest outside capital. We experiment with small no salary team of world-class founders without full-time commitment. If we find traction, we finalize the team and raise funding if necessary.
- Santa Fe Venture Studios is in beta.
- Active Portfolio: 
  - Teleport (video commerce), Stealth (Crypto Fintech), Stealth (Crypto Protocol), Stealth (commerce)
